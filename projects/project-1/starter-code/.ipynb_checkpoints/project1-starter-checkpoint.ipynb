The goal of this analysis will be identifying applicant's various evaluation factors (gre, GPA, rank of applicant's undergraduate alma mater) that may influence admission into graduate school given an unspecified time period. By using statistical hypothesis testing, we will determine if a result is statistically significant or not. Using the standard 95% confidence interval, we will assess whether or not a variable is statistically significant. Looking at the variable's p-value, if there is a less than a 5% chance our finding was due to random chance alone, we can say it is statistically significant.\n",

Note: for this analysis, the dataset was provided and we do not have further information to answer the questions. \n",

The tool we would use is Python, and we would build a logistic regression model to assess the statistcal significance of each evaluation factor (gre, GPA, rank of applicant's undergraduate alma mater) as related to admit values.\n",
